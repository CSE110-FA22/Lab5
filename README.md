Check Understanding: 
1. I would not use a unit test, as there are a lot of external factors that could also effect the message going through or not--such as bad internet--which might not be possible to emulate in a unit test. 
2. I would use a unit test on the max lenght feature, as it is an isolated function that can be easily checked with a unit test.
